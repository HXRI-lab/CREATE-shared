## Future Directions

Some tasks on the roadmap.

### Bugs

-   **[BoardGames]** Game pieces recovered with `GamePieceRecoverySystem` are sometimes floating for certain players in a multiplayer session.
-   **[BoardGames]** Scene switching causes tearing in the headset, which could disorient users. Also, immense lag on joining Photon rooms, which might be able to be fixed by having a lobby room, which we connect to before switching rooms.
-   **[Park]** Scooter driving is unstable and could cause motion sickness
-   **[Park]** Land is missing collision in certain places, allowing the boat to pass through
-   **[Park]** Boat collisions with land are buggy and problematic
-   **[Park]** Missing teleport reticle and teleport zone is improperly set up, so most of the map is not teleportable

### Future features

-   **[All]** Audio/music control menu
-   **[All]** Use [Meta Avatars](https://www.meta.com/avatars/) in the projects. This has proved challenging to work, as avatars are generated according to a script at runtime. Nontrivial to get working with Photon PUN.
-   **[Park]** Add basketball
-   **[Park]** Adapt boat/scooter physics to a golf cart
-   **[Arcade]** Finalize environment
-   **[Arcade]** Add completed water gun + bottles game to environment
